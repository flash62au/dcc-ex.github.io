********************************
Ready-To-Run - Getting Started
********************************

The |EX-CSB1| addresses the needs of DCC-EX users who want a ready-to-run DCC CommandStation, which will have them running trains within 5 minutes of plugging it into power and track, and which has built-in fast Wifi capability.

This DCC-EX Command Station can now outperform commercial DCC command stations, which typically have single 3-3.5A or 5A output capabilities, at a fraction of the cost and providing more advanced features.

The |EX-CSB1| is the second offering in the DCC-EX open source hardware ecosystem specifically designed for model railroaders, and is a direct result of the strong community engagement |DCC-EX| strives to inspire.
