Welcome to the home for |DCC-EX| Automation.

|EX-R| is an "|EX-R-FULL|" that can easily be used to describe sequential command 'sequences' to automatically take place on your model layout. 

These sequences are defined programmatically in a simple command script file, and uploaded to the Command Station once to configure it. |EX-R| will then run automatically on |EX-CS| startup or if trigger manually or on occurrence of the specified events.

Click 'Next' to explore the possibilities of |EX-R|.
