Introduction
============

A common question we see is why should someone choose our |EX-CS| over the many commercial systems that are available. This page is a brief discussion of some of the advantages and disadvantages of |EX-CS| and the whole |DCC-EX| ecosystem.

First and foremost, there is nothing fundamentally wrong with any of the commercial offerings. While we believe strongly in out products, The commercial systems do have some advantages that we can't match. So we fully understand that the |EX-CS| is not necessarily the best option for everyone.

Areas of Comparison
-------------------

This page will compare the following areas in broad a generic terms:

Cost
^^^^

Hands down, the |EX-CS| is the cheapest DCC Command Station option available. 

Depending on the configuration you choose, the cheapest commercial equivalent will be three, or more, times more expensive.  Also, it won't have a fraction of the built in features (see below) that the |EX-CS| has, which you will likely have to pay additionally for, in the commercial systems.

Purchasing
^^^^^^^^^^

This is one area where the commercial systems win out. You can walk into store and pick up a commercial Command Station in a box with comprehensive manuals and know that it is all there and that will work first time.

With the |EX-CS|, while we now have sellers that supply a complete system, most people purchase parts from different suppliers online.  This can therefore take some time to arrive, and there have been issues occasionally with poorly manufactured boards. So in general it is not as plug-and-play.

Setup complexity / Usability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unless you purchased a complete system from one of our reseller, along with the purchasing process the commercial systems are a *lot simpler* to setup.

Loading the software, assembling the boards, making a case, etc. while not individually difficult steps, can be still be daunting for some people. Conversely, for some this becomes part of the attraction/challenge.  Like the building a kit loco or building.  Some people enjoy it, some don't.

Once the systems are setup, there is not a lot of difference in terms of usability between the commercial systems and a |EX-CS|.

Built in Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here the |EX-CS| wins hands down.

DCC *and DC* loco control, Auto-Reverser, WiFi throttles, Rosters, |EX-R|, |JMRI| connectivity via WiFi or USB, and other features that are built into |EX-CS| that *generally* require additional addons to the Commercial Systems.  For example, I can think of one brand, where the USB connectivity add-on alone is more expensive the an entire |EX-CS|.

However, there are features that a built into some of the commercial systems, that are not exactly *built into* |EX-CS|, including:

- CV programming  (|EX-CS| requires the use of |ED|, |JMRI| or |EX-WT| which, while are all free, require additional hardware.)
- FastClock

Options/Expansion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|EX-CS| fares very well in this space.

Over and above the built in features (above), the |EX-CS| supports IoTT connectivity, |EX-TT|, |EX-IO|, with more to come.  |DCC-EX| is evolving on a daily basis. (See Community below.)

Having said that, most of the commercial system have different expansion options. However, some of these only go to fill in the features that come out of the box with the |EX-CS|.  In their favour they are generally plug and play, whereas the |DCC-EX| options require some tinkering.

Support
^^^^^^^

This is more of a mixed bag.

While, the commercial systems you are more-or-less guaranteed support, replacement for faulty items, etc.  The catch is that depending on where you are in the world and where the manufacturer is, there can be long turnarounds to get that support.  Even longer to get replacements or repairs.

Because the |DCC-EX| team are located world-wide, there is usually someone that can help you within a few hours. 

In terms of replacement/repairs, unless you purchased through one of our resellers, it is up to you to deal with this side of the process.  The positive is that, if you wish, the costs are so low that you can keep spares of most items and still be well under the total cost of a commercial system.

Community
^^^^^^^^^

While the commercial systems have strong followings, and there are plenty of people on various forums that will be happy to discuss the systems or provide help, they can't compare to the |DCC-EX| community.

|DCC-EX| maintains a `Discord Server <https://discord.gg/sWNPUsg8>`_ where hundreds of people world-wide are actively engaged in discussing and evolving the |EX-CS| and it add-ons.
